**USAGE EXAMPLE**

To get started with the Simple Bootstrap Product Page, open up the index.html file in your preferred code editor. To make changes to the appearance of the file, use the bootstrap.min.css and the product.css files.

Please note that two typefaces from [Adobe Typekit](https://typekit.com/)---Karla Bold and Filson Soft Bold---are being used in the code. To use these typefaces, sign in to your Adobe Typekit account and create a web kit. Than, replace the code in the <head> tag of the index.html file with the code provided by Adobe. If you do not have an Adobe Typekit account, change the font families listed in the bootstrap.min.css file and remove the Typekit code from the <head> of the index.html file.
